# Plotting Graphs and Tables from the Experimental Results

## Running the example notebook

After conducting the experiments, you can see the graph or the table by using the notebook file [[example.ipynb](example.ipynb)].
The generated graphs and tables will be stored in the folders ```figures/``` and ```htmls/```, respectively.
See [example.ipynb](example.ipynb) file.

For example, you can obtain graphes and tables by using [example.ipynb](example.ipynb) for the DBLP dataset. Note that if you want to see the graphes and tables for other datasets, what you have to do is to change the variable ```dataNames```.

### Generating training data

Here are two graphs of execution time versus data size for the ```base``` and ```prefix-aug``` datasets.

#### Base training data

#### Prefix-aug training data

### Cardinality estimation

Here is the table which shows ```q-error``` of estimated cardinalites for the DBLP dataset.
